# Octree-algorithm-project

This project is used for learning purpose only. The project implements a standard Octree algorithm using JavaScript and the Three.js library. The Octree is used for 3D spatial partitioning by recursively subdividing space into smaller cubes (nodes) and adding spheres in each. Created objects are saved to LAS format file and delivered to pc.
