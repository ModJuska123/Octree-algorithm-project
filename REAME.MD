Here's a concise README for your Octree algorithm implementation in JavaScript:

Octree Algorithm Implementation
This project implements a standard Octree algorithm using JavaScript and the Three.js library. The Octree is used for efficient 3D spatial partitioning by recursively subdividing space into smaller cubes (nodes). This is particularly useful for handling large sets of points in 3D space.

Features
OctreeNode class represents each node (cube) in the tree.
Insert points into the Octree structure recursively.
Subdivide nodes when the number of points exceeds the specified limit.
Query points within a specific range in 3D space.
Three.js integration for visualizing points.
Installation
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Three.js installed in your project.
Include the OctreeNode and Sphere classes in your project.
Usage
Create an Octree root node with a specific center and size:

js
Copy code
const octree = new OctreeNode(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0), 100);
Insert points into the Octree:

js
Copy code
const point = new THREE.Vector3(1, 2, 3);
octree.insert(point);
Query points within a range:

js
Copy code
const searchRange = new OctreeNode(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0), 20);
const foundPoints = octree.query(searchRange);
Use Three.js to visualize the points in 3D space.
